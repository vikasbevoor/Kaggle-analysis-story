Since the investment in ML in many countries is increasing, more and more companies (both small and big) are adopting ML methods, the opportunity is going to increase for the new ML and data science enthusiasts. Hence, most of these CNEs are not going to hold the status of ‘Currently Not Employed’ for the longer period of time.
